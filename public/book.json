    "book_review": " Preface Many enthusiastic readers of my first novel, Bela Obelar Galpo,have eagerly encouraged me to start working on my next book. This encouragement was crucial to overcoming my lethargy. My love goes out to them. With the tireless support of my nephew Sarwar in Toronto, the transcription of the handwritten manuscript has been completed. I am grateful to him for providing this opportunity. Mahfuz Mujahid took on the responsibility of transcribing the text. I also thank Mahfuz. Asif Hossain came to New York from Curtis Court, avoiding COVID-19, to take my photograph. According to him, a new book needs a new photo. I am grateful for his enthusiasm and love. One thing I want to clarify beforehand: the story, including its characters and social context, is entirely fictional. If any tolerant reader finds any similarities, it is purely coincidental, and in that case, I will be happy to have created a compelling story. Hamid Reza Khan",

    "book_review": " Samina Begum's day begins with a prayer. For Talib, Tanim, and Tahmeer; that they may be happy, healthy, and well. She prays for her husband, that he may stay righteous and be in peace in the hereafter. Samina Begum doesn't ask for much for herself from God. She wants to live and die with faith. If any girl from the village comes to know about this, they pray for her by name; may she be blessed, may she be blessed. She lives her life amidst the sight of the land and the boundaries of the sight of her virtuous sister-in-law. Samina’s widowed sister-in-law Sukhiya. Abandoned by her husband’s family, Sukhiya has taken refuge with her brother’s family. She doesn’t want to go to her father's house in Shantinagar. The seven-eight years she spent with Samina in that atmosphere are not too few. According to tradition and customs, the ropes of the body have loosened; those ropes feel looser over the years. She looks after her elder brother’s wife Sukhiya’s children. It’s not much trouble for her. Rather, she enjoys it. Sukhiya also participates in the household work and shares in the domestic responsibilities. Hence, people do not feel the lack of a servant. Thus, the family s large house and its maintenance cost a lot of money for Samina Begum's husband as the head of the family. People estimate, say, the family house requires a lot of money. It is a common thought among the people. An extremely beautiful village, Heejlanagar. There is no river next to Kashirkathi. However, there are large ponds around. Small and large canals and rivers are connected. There are sugar cane forests on the banks of the river",
